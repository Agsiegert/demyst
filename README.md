This is a template to start off with for going through through the Rails Demystified
Book.

The pry gem has been included in this application to help readers debug their
application as they built it up.  You will only need to add in a `binding.pry`
to the file you wish to inspect, requiring pry will not be necessary.

Throughout the book there may be instances where you need to create a file
that is referenced.  If you don't see that file in this template app, then
create it yourself under the directory specified in this book.
